- monitor pe file when running with procmon and procexp
- found program using dll "fathom.dll" to perform some data assign and validate flag
- debug program, put breakpoint on every entry of exported function in dll and select random gif to know how dll handler when image is selected
- when select a gif, fathom.dll using SetFile function to do somthing with data it recvice and assign data to derelict, flot, lagan, jet variable in fathom.dll
-> try to select all image to get the value of each one then click on check button => found function it using to check and printout result
- analyse check function, only Jet and Flot data effect flag validate result
- found flag validate method
+ flag[i] = (initdata[i] ^ flot[i]) - jet[i])
+ flag md5 == 6c5215b12a10e936f8de1e42083ba184
- init data is hardcode in dll
- while breakon SetFIle function, looking around memory dump and lucky found some readable script, get 3 part of flot and jet script:
part1$='flotsam:PXopvM'
part2$='flotsam:DFWEyEW'
part3$='flotsam:BGgsuhn'

part1$='jetsam:SLdkv'
part2$='jetsam:newaui'
part3$='jetsam:HwdwAZ'

- Try collected data to get recover flag and lucky that it work
=> flag[i] = (initdata[i] ^ flot[i]) - jet[i]
