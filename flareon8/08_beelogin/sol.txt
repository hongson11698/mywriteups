- deobfuscate js script in html file to understand logic
- found script decrypt a base64 data, output will be a javascript to execute with eval() function
- key using on decrypt process is 64 bytes long
*** bruteforce key using z3, thing that using first 64 byte data will work => got more than 500k result and still continue to run
=> give up => pm @zvikam and know that we need more data for z3 to improve result
- => increase to 0x4000 byte like hint of @zvikam, found that out put will contain js comment at certain position
- adjust z3-solver script, add need constrain base on result => repeat for many time => try using text score method to find valid key
- using valid key, decrypt data and get same function required other 64 bytes key length
- do the same thing on step 1 and get flag
