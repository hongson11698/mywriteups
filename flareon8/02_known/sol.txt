- look at binary, found decrypt_data function
- analyse decrypt_data => dec = rol(enc ^ k, i) - i
- key is 8 character
- data of file is divide to 8 byte block to decrypt
- found a encrypted file is a png, header of png is "137 80 78 71 13 10 26 10"
- try to recovery key from png header => k = ror(enc + i) ^ dec
- recovery key success then decrypt data
=> found flag from decrypted data
