- when close program, a shellcode will be excute on memmory alloc by VirtualAllocExNuma function
- after some step in shellcode, final dll contain "Start" function will be loaded
- analyze dll, found first condition to run is name of image is Spell.EXE
- after that, dll will call a "check" function:
+ "check" function connect to a domain, if it cant connect or not recv correct data from server, program will exits
+ the code after check doesn't do anything with data recv from server
=> by pass server check by noping "check" call
- dll encrypt "flare-on.com" string and write to Spell registry key with valuename is "1"
*** found that dll will continue decrypt a string data => stupidly think that can found flag before it encrypt and write to registry like part1 => got wired string and get stucked

*** think that i missing something with check funciton or orignal pe file => diging check function => found no thing new => crying
*** diging pe file => tried to understand how it load dll => found nothing new => crying and dm @zvikam for help => know the wired string is not ordered string => return to analyze dll
=> debug program to get right order and right key for each part of encrypted flag then decrypt flag
=> merge "0" and "1" data from registry to get full encrypted flag
